I want to understand how well my resume matches the job description below and what I should improve.

### Job Description:
{JOB_DESCRIPTION}

### My Resume:
{RESUME}

### What I need from you:
1. Compare my resume to the job description.
2. Identify strengths and areas where my resume already aligns well.
3. Point out gaps, missing skills, or responsibilities I should highlight more clearly.
4. Suggest improvements I can make without inventing new experience.
5. Provide the output in this structure:
   - Alignment Summary
   - Strengths
   - Gaps and Missing Elements
   - Keyword Opportunities
   - Section-by-Section Recommendations

Make the recommendations practical, honest, and focused on improving ATS alignment.
